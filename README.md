# my_first_calculator
this is the first calcualtor i made! it took me a while to make but it is much more complicated than my "hello world" program!

# why did i make this?
calculators are very important in our day to day life and we use it a lot when making programs!

now, you can import my calculator file and then it will do the calculations for you.

# how long did this take?
i dont think it is very important to share this information, i just hope my time was worth it

# can i help contribute?
yes! i dont have much time to work on this anymore, and it does take a while to make these

if you have made extensions or a takeaway and multiply calculator please contribute to this thanks

# there are bugs in your code
this program is very big and i do not have time to test everything,

if there is bug, can you please create an issue and i will try fix it
